# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-with-R
Text mining twitter user sentiment of Verizon using R

##Introduction
The goal of this project is to analyze twitter user sentiment regarding the celluar and internet provider Verizon. I used R to get user tweet data from Twitter's API. Then using the `tidytext` package and AFINN lexicon function (a list of english terms rated from -5(negative) to +5(positive) based on sentiment), to analyze user sentiment. I then visualized the sentiment scores using ggplot.
